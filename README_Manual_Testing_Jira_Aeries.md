# Testing Project for Demo Application Aeries #

<br>

___Short Description of the Tool and Functionality Under Test___

<br>

Aeries is a Student Data Management System for California and Texas designed to facilitate day to day school matters for students, parents and teachers, who can access school data via separate portals.  

Testing is focused on the Aeries Student Data Confirmation Process, a re-enrollment activity happening at the start of each school year and which is done via a Confirmation form that Parents must complete via the Parent Portal.

The Testing Environments used for this process are the Aeries Demo Parent Portal and Aeries Demo Admin Portal

The Tools used for managing the testing process are Jira and Zephyr Squad

<br>

___Functional Specifications:___

___Final Testing Conclusions___

As part of this testing process, the functionality in scope for testing was the "Data Confirmation" form, whose analysis was divided into two stories, namely the "Data Confirmation Process as a Parent" and the "Data Confirmation Process as a Teacher/Admin".
The environment used for testing is a demo application, which both parents and teacher can use to familiarize themselves with how the process works.

In total, 16 tests have been executed which cover both stories and 3 bugs have been identified and reported.

The identified bugs are quite severe, since they affect a parent's ability to input and change data that is crucial for the wellbeing and security of the child, namely adding contact information for the student, including student's phone number and updating the list of contacts who afre authorized to act in the benefit of the student. Moreover, the submitted data can be temporarily edited, and although, upon page refresh the intially submitted data is kept, this can create confusion and further distrust in the overall confirmation process.

From a teacher's perspective, no actual bugs have been discovered, since the teachers can perform the setup for the "Confirmation" process, can block a parent from having access to other portal tabs until they finish submitting the "Confirmation" form and they can emulate a parent during the "Confirmation" process.

Therefore, the three bugs are critical and must be prioritized for fixing and re-testing and a subsequent regression testing must be done for the entire "Confirmation" process to ensure that no other defects have been produced by the fix applied to the system.
